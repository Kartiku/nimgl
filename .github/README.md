## About

NimGL (Nim Game Library) is a collection of bindings for popular libraries,
mostly used in computer graphics. *A library of libraries.*

This collection of bindings is heavily inspired by LWJGL3, it enables low level
access and it is not a framework, so we highly encourage you to use a game
engine if you do not have experience working with low level graphics
development. This bindings contain several optional helper procedures to help
with the development and to better suit it to the language.

## Getting Started

We highly recommend using a Nimble project to easily add requirements such as
NimGL.

### Installation

1. Install Nimble, it comes pre installed with Nim. If you want to use the
   development NimGL version you must use a version older than 0.10.2,
   specifically anything after hash `7c2b9f6`
2. Directly install via Nimble
```sh
nimble install nimgl # nimgl@#1.0 to use the development version
```
3. (Optional) Add it to your .nimble file
```nim
requires "nimgl >= 0.3.6" # nimgl >= 1.0.0 if using the development version
```

It is currently being developed and tested on

- Windows 10
- MacOS Mojave
- Linux Ubuntu 18.10

### Usage

Please refer to each binding documentation to further understand its usage.

### Green Window Example
```nim
import nimgl/[glfw, opengl]

proc keyProc(window: GLFWWindow, key: GLFWKey, scancode: int32,
             action: GLFWKeyAction, mods: GLFWKeyMod): void {.cdecl.} =
  if key == keyESCAPE and action == kaPress:
    window.setWindowShouldClose(true)

proc main() =
  assert glfwInit()

  glfwWindowHint(whContextVersionMajor, 3)
  glfwWindowHint(whContextVersionMinor, 2)
  glfwWindowHint(whOpenglForwardCompat, GLFW_TRUE) # Used for Mac
  glfwWindowHint(whOpenglProfile, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE)
  glfwWindowHint(whResizable, GLFW_FALSE)

  let w: GLFWWindow = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, "NimGL")
  if w == nil:
    quit(-1)

  discard w.setKeyCallback(keyProc)
  w.makeContextCurrent()

  assert glInit()

  while not w.windowShouldClose:
    glfwPollEvents()
    glClearColor(0.68f, 1f, 0.34f, 1f)
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
    w.swapBuffers()

  w.destroyWindow()
  glfwTerminate()

main()
```

## Contribute

Your contributions truly mean the world to this project, if you are missing some
procedures, bindings or functionality feel free to open an Issue with the
specification and some example on how to properly implement it.  For the
adventurous also feel free to open a Pull Request which will be greatly
appreciated.  
Thank you so much :tada:

## Supported Bindings

| Library              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [GLFW][glfw-url]     | Create multiple windows, handle user input (keyboard, mouse, gaming peripherals) and manage contexts. Also features multi-monitor support, clipboard access, file drag-n-drop, and much more. |
| [OpenGL][opengl-url] | Open Graphics Library is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. NimGL only supports modern OpenGL.                       |
| [ImGUI][imgui-url]   | Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application.                 |
| [stb_image][stb-url] | Image loading/decoding from file/memory: JPG, PNG, TGA, BMP, PSD, GIF, HDR, PIC                                                                                                               |

## Roadmap

Goals for before June of 2020:

- Implement automatic generation for all bindings, if not possible at least
  facilitate its manual modification.
- Add better documentation for each binding.
- Add Vulkan into the mixture.
- Create optional helper functions for each binding to further facilitate
  development.
- Make a thesis paper in Spanish and do my best to translate it to English.
- CI integration with Travis

Each binding contains a small credits comment at the top of the file, but in
general thank you to every contributor of each individual library used in this
project :rose:.
