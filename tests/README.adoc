== Examples

This examples purpose is to help check the stability of the bindings and to give some example on how to use them on
other projects. So feel free to check the tests and learn on how to use them.

I still need to add more examples to test the stability of the bindings. Some bindings depend on another bindings for
certain functionality so expect some tests to contain several bindings.

As this is a graphics library it needs some specific hardware that most of the computers have but cannot test on some
CI servers. In the future it would be nice to implement the CI service with Xvfb.
